# Deployment Workflow

After making any code changes, **always** commit and deploy:

## Workflow Steps

1. **Stage changes**: `git add <changed-files>`
2. **Commit with descriptive message**: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main` (triggers Render autodeploy for backend)
4. **Build frontend**: `npm run build` (from `sms-tracker` directory)
5. **Deploy frontend**: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

## Important Notes

- **Backend (server/)**: Pushing to GitHub automatically triggers Render deployment
- **Frontend**: Must manually build and deploy to Firebase after changes
- **Always deploy both**: Even if only one part changed, ensure both are deployed
- **Test after deployment**: Verify changes work in production environment

## Example Commands

```bash
# After making changes to server code
cd sms-tracker
git add server/server.js
git commit -m "Fix CORS: Add firebaseapp.com origin"
git push origin main
# Render will auto-deploy

# After making changes to frontend code
cd sms-tracker
git add src/components/Contacts.jsx
git commit -m "Reset grade filter after delete all"
git push origin main
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Never Skip Deployment

- Don't just commit without deploying
- Don't assume changes will auto-deploy (only backend does)
- Always verify deployment completed successfully
